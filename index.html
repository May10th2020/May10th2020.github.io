                    <h2>The beginning to a better life... </h2>
                    <p>Where do I even start. First of all I am not creative like you are so I will express my love for you the way I can and know how to. This picture right, is Where
                        my life changed, this right here is when I finally became the happiest I could ever be. From going the Fairview with Bianca and trying to figure out how to ask you
                        out properly, to going to her house and making a poster, those were the best moments of my life. Every single seconds leading up to this moment was felt with joy
                        and happiness. I honestly can't tell you what I was feeling, it was something that I havent felt before. Anyways fast forwarding to me arriving at your house and making
                        you think that we are going for a nice dinner and you dressed all cute and all, wearing that beautiful pink shirt. As I was hiding in the trunk, my heart was racing every step
                        you took closer towards the trunk. Finally I get to ask the most beautiful, sweetest, caring girl in world. Someone that puts someones needs before hers,
                        someone who drop everything and go help a person. This the person I needed in my life, a person that has such a golden heart, someone that is literally sent 
                        by god himself. The smile that I got on my face when you said yes, I dont think Ive smiled like that before or ever felt something like that before ever. The happiness
                        you gave me, the joy that filled me up, the warm feeling inisde of me, all of that because of you, because someone so perfect became mine. Well of coure I didnt ask you out 
                        your brother asked you out for me, but hey we will say I asked you out. You know the first time we ever talked, I felt so comfortable with you, I felt myself with you
                        I just felt that connection with you that I havent felt with anyone before. You know you became such an important person in my life that without you in it its like the earth
                        without the sun, the galaxy without the stars. You complete me in ways that I cant even describe, you are my other half, you make up the other half of me.
                        There is not a better feeling waking up and going to sleep knowing that I have you, knowing that I love you, knowing that this perfect person belongs to me. You know if someone came 
                        up to me and told me you can have anything in the world, anything you desire, but I have to give you up, with no hesitation and no doubt I would be like okay deal. I want $100 billion
                        (JK)with no hesitation and no doubt I would say the only thing I want is my sweet girlfriend Arianna. No matter what we go through no matter what you do, my heart will always choose 
                        you. This is how you made me feel when you said yes, and from that moment on, you just made me feel more and more myself, more happy. You literally changed my Life with just one word "YES"
                        and I will never ever forget how you made me feel that day.

                    <h2>Where it all started</h2>
                    <p>Lets go back a bit to where to it all started. The place where I start realizing what I have infront of me. It took me some time but at the lake 
                        of George Town I knew I wanted to be with you. I knew that I want to hold you, and kiss you, and love you. When we were at the lake and I was holding you so you dont finally
                        I just used that as an excuse to hold you, and be close to you. I did want to kiss you badly but it just didnt feel right yet. When I was asking you to sit next to me during the plays
                        I genuily wanted to be next to you, to be close to you but I was too scared to tell you how I felt. At first I wasnt too sure about you, I came from rough past relationships and I was 
                        questioning my self if its worth getting into another one, but something about you made me feel different, something about you made me feel like I can fall in love with you and not get hurt
                        something about you made me feel so alive, and honestly I do not regret any second that I spend with you and spend loving you. Starting off as friends first, then becoming bestfriends
                        and then falling in love with eachother, thats just a love story anyone would die for. We had something so special going on as friends, but right now we have something so much better
                        and honestly I do not regret a single bit of our friendship and relationship. You were a really great friend to me, even though I was always mean to you in a friendly way and that time
                        where I pulled that prank that I cant be your friend anymore(To that day, its still the funniest prank Ive pulled on you, and there are more coming). But honestly I am so glad that I got to be 
                        on the same bus as you, and Im glad we went to that lake, because that was the time that I realized I want you.
